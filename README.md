# Weather Journal App

An asynchronous web app that uses the [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI.

## Project Dependencies

- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - runs a local server.
- CORS package - allows for communication across the web.
- Body-Parser package (middleware) - allows parsing the data passed through routes on our local Express server.
